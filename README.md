This project focuses on the development of a Voice Controlled Robot for Object Finding, utilizing two Arduinos and an ESP32 CAM to create a functional and innovative solution. The project incorporates the YOLOv7 model for object detection.

## Description

The Voice Controlled Robot for Object Finding enables users to command the robot to search for specific objects. The robot utilizes voice commands given by the user through a laptop connected to the vehicle via Wi-Fi. Once the command is received, the robot starts its search for the specified object.

## Key Features

- Voice control: The user can command the robot using voice commands through a connected laptop.
- Object detection: The YOLOv7 model is used to detect and identify objects in the environment.
- Object finding: The robot performs a search for the specified object until it is found.
- User notification: Once the object is located, the robot notifies the user.

## Components Used

- Two Arduinos
- ESP32 CAM
- Laptop
- Wi-Fi connection

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `https://github.com/ArjHub/VC-Car-For-Object-Finding`
2. Install the necessary dependencies using the package manager of your choice.
3. Connect the Arduinos and ESP32 CAM according to the provided circuit diagram.
4. Ensure that the laptop and the robot are connected to the same Wi-Fi network.
5. Set up the YOLOv7 model for object detection. Refer to the model documentation for instructions.
6. Launch the application on the laptop and start giving voice commands for object finding.

## Usage

1. Power on the robot and ensure it is connected to the laptop via Wi-Fi.
2. Open the application on the laptop.
3. Speak the voice command specifying the object to be found.
4. The robot will start its search for the object using the YOLOv7 model.
5. If the object is located, the user will be notified.
6. Continue giving voice commands for further object finding tasks.
